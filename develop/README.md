## Description
* If you’re one of those people who has trouble keeping plants alive, the problem is probably not your thumb… it’s knowing what your plant needs, when it needs it, and how to do it.
* Often we forget to water our plants because we get busy with other things, or aren’t sure how often they actually need to be watered. Forget-Me-Not Plant Planner offers a centralized place to track your plant care tasks and refer to what your plants need and when.
* As an aspiring gardener, I want to make sure my plants get the best care by creating a schedule of when they are due for watering.
* I want a tool where I can see an overview of all my plants and their likely condition, view care-related details, and, most importantly, see what I need to do when.
* I primarily want to track watering schedules but eventually I would like to add dates for planting, fertilizing, pruning etc.
